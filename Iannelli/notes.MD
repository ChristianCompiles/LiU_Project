diffq are just equations that contain derivatives

x + 1 = 3 is not diffq (linear equation)

y' = -Ly is easy


y` = -L y^2 is laborious

y`` = (d``)^2 - Ly`` is difficult as well



consider solution energy
    generalization of kinetic energy from physics
    
    E = 1/2 y^2
    
    dE/dt = dE/dy * dy/dt
    
    = 1/2 2y * dy/dt
    TEST for dy/dt = -Ly
    
    substitute
    dE/dt = y(-Ly) = -Ly^2
    slope decreases over time so we can spend time and effort to solve problem


Sequences of ordinary DQ
    
    
dy[i]/dt = -(y[i]-y[i-1])

dT/dt = -ptT/ptx
